    "The City of Charlotte has experienced a lot of growth in population, construction and business development in the recent years. In this paper I will perform segmentation analysis of the City of Charlotte, North Carolina for the purposes of understanding the composition of different venues near clusters of households with different characteristics. We'll examine clusters based on just two of several other possible metrics to gain better understanding of some of the charachteristics of the Queen city. \n",

    "For this project I will be using data provided by the City fo Charlotte. The webite where the data resides is located at  http://data.charlottenc.gov/. I will be using two data sets from there, namely the Census Population Block Groups and the Census Household Income Block Groups. The first set  has the Longitude and Latitude of each Census Block Group and the second set contains demographic and income data for each block. A Census Block Group is defined as the smallest geographical unit for which the US Census Bureau publishes data. Typically, there are 600 to 3000 households per block group, but as we'll see later on this is not always the case.\n",

    "The first step of our methodology was to collect location, demographic, income and venues data for the City of Charlotte. We have collected and preprocessed the data as a first step. We'll segment the data set two different ways by Kmeans clustering. The first clustering method will be by Household Median income and the second will be based on population density per Census block i.e. population per square mile. Afterwards we'll use the clusters to create Wordclouds of the venues categories by cluster. This will show us what kind of venues are near each type of population area and help us gain better understanding about the City of Charlotte.  "

    "3. Cluster Label 2 - Household with average income of 40,000. We'll call this group \"Lower Income\". We see that Restaurants are still prominent, but American Restaurants are not as popular there. We see a lot of Convenience stores, Shopping and Parks, but also Fast Food places. \n",

    "**Population Density Clusters**\n",

    "2. Cluster Label 1 - Low Population Density with an average of less than 2,000 per square mile. There is a better mix of venues in this cluster featuring Restaurants, Shopping, Hotels, Sandwitch Places, Fast Food and Parks.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Cluster Label 2 - High Population Density with an average of close to 13,000 per square mile.
